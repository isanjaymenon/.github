# About Community Health files

Default community health files are a set of predefined files that provide guidance and templates for maintaining a healthy and collaborative open source project. You can add default community health files to a public repository called `.github`, in the root of the repository or in the `docs` or `.github` folders. These files help you automate and standardize various aspects of your project's development and community interaction. They are essential for promoting transparency, good practices, and collaboration in open source projects.

GitHub will use and display default files for any repository owned by the account that does not have its own file of that type in any of the following places:

- The root of the repository
- The .github folder
- The docs folder
